* Example_OBIS_INGEST.ipynb 

    This is a jupyter notebook that provides a mix of narrative and code samples in Python (3+) demonstrating how data are manipulated by Axiom staff for visualization on the MBON Portal (https://mbon.ioos.us/?ls=s3ShXuOX#). It demonstrates python library pandas for most wranlging, with some geopandas and other library support for ingesting new tables to the 'behind-the-scenes' technology in use to power the portal.
